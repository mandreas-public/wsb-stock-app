This question should not be considered a request for financial or investment advice nor is it an offer of financial or investment advice. I just like stocks and like to understand factors that influence stock value other than fundamentals.

If a short ladder attack is synthetic (fake) volume targeted at making a certain security fall in value... then would it be reasonable to assume the the security is valued higher than the ladder has brought it to and that it might be an indicated to buy?"

2021-02-01 19:10:29,The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis,0,"The Rolling 20’s - Investing in US Legalization

Hi all! I believe the marijuana industry presents unique growth opportunity through legislative change. Here’s why I am long the sector and eyeing options..

Last week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.

This is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.

>This could potentially foreshadow the most significant catalyst in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry

The ~~Roaring~~ Rolling 2020s 'Will Be Fueled By Weed' As Cannabis Experts Predict Regulatory Shakeups In 2021

>2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far

The marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp; short interest through the roof. 

US Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. 

I strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.

Here are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:

Aphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO

(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs & Green Thumb)

There are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS

Also, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I won’t go into detail, but, we’ve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasn’t pretty.

Politico said ‘There’s no stopping the industry now’: Democratic control is a big win for marijuana 

Stay safe & GLTA!

I am eyeing APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @ 4.20 (currently long)

Check out that bullflag forming on the monthly.

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Aphria is poised for significant growth along with many MSOs*"

>
Over the past week, many people have asked me the same question: “Will the GameStop situation lead to a market crash?” The direct answer is an emphatic NO! However, it will likely lead to increased volatility over the near-term, which is why I suggest traders use lighter than normal positions until the volatility calms down.

>The markets have always been dominated by the large institutions and, for the record, I absolutely love the recent surge in retail trading. Here is one side effect: When retail traders take long positions against the short positions of these big institutions, and then drive up the price of these stocks, it leads to what is called a “short squeeze.” When these institutions are forced to cover a stock, they are sometimes forced to sell their long positions (if the loss is big enough) to meet margin requirements, to reduce leverage, or to possibly raise cash for future redemptions.

>This forced liquidation of long positions can lead to a quick, short-term decline in stock prices, such as the one we saw on Monday, Jan. 25 between 10:45 am.-11:05 a.m. EST, (see chart) but I don’t see it leading to a market crash."

This is not a tiny amount for which can be classed as an ""error"" with clearing, but rather signifying the fact that our thesis that they were naked short-selling was correct. This is a crime. The proof is there, literally, in the data.**

**Source:** [**https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm**](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Hi Guys,

Today the SEC data on the failures to deliver just came out for the first half of January. Note that GME has been on the SEC Threshold List since the 8th of December. This list was created by the SEC to make sure they could keep their eyes on abusive naked short-selling, but just like 2008 they're asleep at the wheel. **When you short a share, you have to deliver the shares to the buyer within 2 days. If not, it's classed as a failure to deliver and signifies that you sold shares without having them or being able to locate them a.k.a naked short-selling**

I just combed through the data on this (you can go through it yourself and add up the ""GME"" failures to deliver) and the failures to deliver added up to **5,074,937** shares. **That's almost 10% of the whole fucking free float.** We don't even have the data on what's happened after the first half of January, but I assume it must be higher because of the even greater price spikes we have seen. 

This is **FUCKING CRIMINAL** and all of these idiots deserve to go to jail for what they've done. They got their hand caught in the cookie jar shorting **140% of the free float** of GME, then halt trading at the same time across the world and then tank to get the paper hands to sell. **Now they're pushing the narrative that we're focusing on silver** which is complete BULLSHIT. **All the posts calling for silver are 2 day old Citadel/Melvin shill accounts, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.**

The facts are on our side. The hedge funds cannot suddenly change the rules of the game so the SEC can't report failures to deliver. The fact that they most of them don't have **ANY SHARES** to actually back their short position, I think that the short interest is still heavily underreported (don't listen to S3 or any of the sellouts, check Finwiz). 

**So, continue holding. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEM BY THE FUCKING BALLS. WE DO, AND IT'S TIME TO PAY THE PIPER.**

More content below
(Bloomberg) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. blew past a five-year high as Reddit investors rallied around a call to start a “#BioWar” on the heavily-shorted biotech that develops rare disease drugs.

The stock, which recently ended development on a Covid-19 drug, rallied as much as 36% on Monday after **a poster on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum called it “the most undervalued stock in the market” while another said a brewing #BioWar was “about sticking it to the shorts in a massive way.”​**

So their tactic is:

1. Make a shitpost here shilling some dumb stock to draw us away from GME

2. Publish an article saying ""Reddit"" is way bullish on dumb stock

3. Boomers buy in

4. Profit

Isn't this the very fucking definition of manipulation?"

It seems that GME peaked after the last dissemination date. 

If that’s the case, could we expect a flat line until the 2/9 dissemination date, or do they have to start covering at the due date? 

Does this even matter? Are these just random dates that I found and I’m becoming even more smoothbrain?

2021-02-01 20:08:11,My Robinhood account was just hacked. Enable 2FA.,56,"Literally 5 minutes ago I was taking notes for a class, okay? And I saw a fleeting notification that someone had requested a password reset for RH. That wasn’t me, for sure. When I checked my email for the reset email, **it was gone**. So now I’m freaking the fuck out because that would mean my email had been hacked too.

Sure enough, I tried to pull up the app on my phone and I was signed out, like holy fuck right? 99% sure that only happens when the password is actually reset, not when someone types your email to *request the reset*.

I went to RH and requested a reset for my email. Clicked to reset and the website said the password couldn’t be reset. So I did the same thing except faster, using lastpass to gin up a safe one immediately. Not sure what the fuck was going on here tbh.

The next thing I did was update my gmail password. Google makes this so freaking complicated that I had to google for a direct link to change it, and that’s now been updated as well.

If I hadn’t been on my phone I wouldn’t have caught this, heck I could have been playing a video game, it scares me to think of it.

All I can say as someone who has always thought 2fa was stupid is USE IT. And use a strong password.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk"
2021-02-01 20:08:03,"To those that recently joined WSB, this GME event may take a while.",110,"I hope new retards that just joined WSB needs to realize that this struggle between Retail Investors and Hedge Funds may take longer than you think. No one knows when the short sqouze will take place. Be ready to HOLD for 2-3 weeks or even longer. We may have the upper hand, but don't think the hedge funds are stupid. They have been playing this short game for decades with a huge war chest funds to see us lose. Be ready for several weeks of FUD, misinformation, and restrictions. Hedge Funds need for us to lose because they need to send a message that they can beat us at this game. They are trying to make the statement ""We will beat you at this because we have everything on our side."" If hedge funds lose here then everything that they have built up will fall a part and change and that's the last thing they want.
Don't invest more than what you can lose. Be safe, go out exercise, and eat. Try not to stay glued to the screen. Best of luck to all you retards and artists.

We have been absolutely destroyed lately by the media and their wet dreams of a Silver squeeze taking place. Something that we have repeatedly said, is not happening. We need to combat these disgusting pricks (i.e. Wall St. and the Media). These pricks have been forcing misinformation down our throats for the past week and I cannot sit by and listen to their bullshit anymore. We must start on our campaign but instead of a misinformation campaign, it must be an informational campaign. The people buying billboards and even planes need to focus some of their capital towards Instagram and FaceBook ads that show that we haven't quit on GME and AMC. We must shove anti silver information down the throats of all the smooth brained idiots buying silver and we must shove the FACT that the shorts have NOT been covered down the throats of anybody who sees these advertisements. I implore anybody with spare capital to purchase social media ads to encourage this so we can fight back against the bullshit media and genuinely EVIL tactics being used by Wall St. I will be buying multiple social media ads and I encourage you all to do the same.

* ""Our data indicates that the shorts will be called on Friday, and by law they have 3 days to cover: any comment on that?""

* ""Three websites all indicate the short volume hasn't changed, but Citadel and Melvin seem to claiming they did. What could explain that discrepancy?""

* ""We're seeing about 5M fails to deliver on shorted GME shares. Compared to other more typical stocks that sit in the low thousands. Do you think this extreme level of failing to deliver could indicate illegal activity?

* Historically we've seen companies who fail to deliver shares ride attempt to ride these situations out - how long could a company ride out a fail to deliver situation and stay solvent?""

* ""Why do you think the SEC doesn't enforce fail to deliver rules with large hedge funds and their supporters while retail customers are required to cover almost immediately?""

* ""The situation with GME seems to shine a light on counterfeiting shares, a process by which made up shares are created out of thin air to cover short positions which in turn dilutes share value - do you think counterfeit shares of GME could be causing issues here?

* If a hedge fund is short on a position and doesn't cover in time required, they can oftentimes buy back a single stock between themselves at any agreed price to push the process forward 21 days, which can then be repeated. How can investors make good investing decisions when the rules seem to be written so that hedge funds don't have to play by them?

* A ladder attack is where hedge funds can coordinate sales back and forth in short succession in order to drive a price down during low volume periods - is this something the SEC should be reviewing the legality of?

* Can you explain to our viewers why is makes sense to be able to short more stock than exists for a company? Doesn't that make any over-shorted stock vulnerable to a similar situation as the hedge funds holding GME short positions right now?

I could literally go on and on and on. Journalists - you have so many interesting questions for these fucks yet you just keep asking the same tired questions meant to imply that somehow ""retail investors"" are the problem!

When the short squeeze happens retail traders will 100% be locked out of their accounts due to ""network outage"".  During this outage retail traders will be unable to cash in during the short squeeze while its happening.  Fidelity and other trading platforms that allowed GME trading because they weren't tied to clearinghouses that had short interests but have long interests in GME will now have a motive to make retail investors the bag holder while they cash out on the short squeeze.   I'm a retard and have no idea how to battle this but maybe someone less retarded than me does.   All I know is that no retail traders will be able to trade over the internet and we need to start making a game plan now.

The longs haven’t won the battle yet though: whoever is holding the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have two days to deliver the shares. 

If I was in their position, would I start covering today and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK no.

Instead, I would try to initiate a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down. At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.

By pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.

If the hail mary works this way, they can get away alive tomorrow.

However, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze, but a squeeze nonetheless). 

Panic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who don’t have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.


**TLDR: squeeze didn’t happen today because shorts have one day of breathing room. Don’t just 💎✋🤲, BUY until we are at $300.**

2021-02-01 21:07:39,What’s the real short interest %?,49,"Alright, someone who’s smart check my numbers: 

Shares outstanding: 69.75M

% held by insiders: 27.33% - 19.06M

Float: 69.75 - 19.06 = 50.69M

This is the float everyone is using to calculate SI% seems like.

According to a few sites (correct me if I’m wrong), the two largest shareholders are Blackrock - 9.22M and RC - 9.00M, they own more than 10% each so we know for sure they’re in because they’d have to disclose position changes.

That’s 18.22M shares not available in the float. So our very most conservative estimate would be that the actual float is near 32.47M shares.

Keep in mind that is the most conservative (highest) number we can confirm at this time, and with S3s new “data” that there’s 28M shares shorted now, that’s still 86% SI.

Throw in another 5M shares owned by institutions and the real SI (assuming they won’t sell in the short term) is over 100%.

What does all this published estimated SI have to do with anything? If they are using the 50M float number, aren’t their %s completely useless and misleading?

IF there are truly only 28M shares shorted left, is the squeeze really over, or are they still shorted 86-100+ % ???"

I am making this post to sort the 'truth' from 'HF fiction'. Also, don't forget that I am just some monkey with a keyboard so none of this is financial advice.

**Real Stuff:**

\- The short squeeze has not yet happened

\- We are STILL HOLDING

\- Our stocks of choice are still GME, AMC, BB, and NOK

\- We own a massive portion of the floating market share, which is stiff-arming the HFs because they desperately need our shares to cover their shorts, they are paying tens of millions in interest on their shorts per DAY to avoid the billions of losses that come from closing their short positions

**Made Up Hocus Pocus:**

\- There is NO potential for a silver squeeze (This is pushed by Citadel as they own a LOT of silver, but long, not short and they need funds to fight on GME) Buying silver would only hand Citadel and Melvin money to fight us on GME. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9gv98/citadel\_is\_the\_5th\_largest\_owner\_of\_slv\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9gv98/citadel_is_the_5th_largest_owner_of_slv_its/))

\- Citadel and Melvin have most certainly NOT covered their shorts. They claimed that they had right after we saw barely any market movement and when they cover their shorts, we'll know because the market will jump with all the buy pressure (Also, why would they put the effort in to try and shift our focus to silver, or to try and convince us that they already covered, or continue driving the price down with short ladders, or the trade limitations on Thursday and Friday? If they had already covered they wouldn't care at all what happens because they would be out of their positions.)

\- We have NOT lost interest in any of the aforementioned stocks (GME, AMC, BB, and NOK). We have diamond hands, not paper hands 💎✋ 💎✋

(🚀🚀🚀 to keep you interested)

Understanding options takes a lot of time and effort, they are complicated and confusing. DO NOT TOUCH OPTIONS until you understand the risks involved. Once you think you understand them, keep doing research until you find out things you haven't learned and realized if you had made the trades before you learned these things you would have lost a lot of money.

2021-02-01 22:09:31,🚀🚀🚀Rocket Mortgage $RKT to the moon 🚀🚀🚀,0," **Mortgage market is hot (and your wife)**

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates, bored people has made desperate wifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day. 

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today’s money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Loan Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refi’s which do not add to the volume, **there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.**

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company’s its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It’s probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That’s lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people’s minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

Positions 400 shares at $21.50. Thinking about some options too but don't have the balls to do a 30c 2/19 yet.

I am heavily invested in GME because I really like the stock. But...i do not think I will like the stock in 6+ months. I dont think GME will be worth 20bn in 6 months. After the squeeze...which might not happen...the share price could easily return to a significantly lower valuation. 

Why wouldnt the sqeeze happen? Well, only 20% of the outstanding public shares are owned by us little retard hands. That means the major price fluctuations are largely caused by massive hedge funds far larger than Melvin. We dont even know for sure that Melvin still holds the shorts. Another Mega Hedge could have bought them out and repositioned in a much better time frame. This fund could also be one of the major gamestop shareholders. What this means is that if the major shareholders decide to dump the stock will be left around 40-80 dollars a share at the current valuation.

Sticking it to the billionaires is the most room temperature IQ ""movement"" i have ever seen in my multiple years here and I congratulate each and every one of you retards for thinking thats whats happening. Most of the profits from this movement are going to go the hedge funds and insitutions that make Marvin captial look like your autistic son in the sand pit compared to your wifes boyfriend. 

The real kickers is that if they really do get left with 20-70 billion in debt they will most likely get bailed out by Mr. Rothschild and the fed and the American citizens will be left to pay back the debt with their tax dollars once again lining the pockets of billionaires.

TLDR: If you single brain cell ""investors"" are right and Melvin is stuck with a 70bn dollar bill the american peoples tax dollars will pay it and most of the profits will go to even larger cap hedge funds. Really sticking it to the billionaires retards. HOLD SHARES IN CASE I HAVE .5 brain cells and go long dated PUT options for when gamestop realizes its true market value."

Note: My original post got removed, and I never got a reason why, so here we go again! Since that post got removed some time last Friday, the stock has ripped 25%

Tldr: Compelling artificial intelligence software + top-notch management + green new deal + stonk hasn’t already gone 100x = massive gains 🚀🚀🚀🚀

STPK recently completed a merger with Stem Inc., positioning the company as an industry leader within the smart energy storage market.

This is a pure energy play that has yet to already go through multiple parabolic moves like many other EV/solar/battery oriented stocks

Star Peak's leadership is rock solid brings experience that will be crucial to commercializing/marketing Stem's products. The transition from fossil fuels to green energy through government enacted incentives gives Star Peak a terrific tailwind to begin building upon in 2021.

The biggest upside for Star Peak over other recent acquisition mergers is actually the minimal downside this stock offers. With \~$525 million of cash available and no debt on Stem's balance sheet, Star Peak has very little negatives IMO, Not to mention the stock has taken a bit of a dump recently so now may not be a terrible time to get in - at the end of the day though there will be volatility, and this is definitely not something to enter if you are worried about the price dropping in the near term. If star peak can play their cards right, I believe the upside potential here is massive

Good luck hombres!

Positions: long shares: STPK, Nvidia, Google, BlackBerry, many more stonks.

2021-02-01 22:29:25,"TD ""news"" alert on AMC stock Ticker (clear misinformation tactics)",11," 17:22:00 Reddit Users Fuel Rally in Silver -- 4th update.

 

Online investors who spurred a trading frenzy in the shares of GameStop        Corp. and AMC        Entertainment Holdings Inc. have moved onto the global silver        market, powering the precious metal to its biggest one-day advance in        more than a decade.     

Futures prices for silver in New        York on Monday settled at their highest level in eight years,        the latest work by a loosely knit group of speculators who congregate on        social-media platforms including Reddit's WallStreetBets. Some        participants have been contending aggressive buying could power GameStop-like,        quadruple-digit percentage gains in other arenas, with some chatter over        the weekend focusing on the roughly $50 billion market        for silver investments.     

The idea of buying silver in unison was mentioned in the popular Reddit        forum WallStreetBets last week, then quickly spread to other corners of        the internet, even as many Reddit users said they weren't behind the        silver-market advance. Many investors piled into silver bars and coins        online, along with silver-linked exchange traded-funds and shares of        silver producers.     

Many traders with experience in commodities say the trade is highly        speculative. There is more than enough silver to meet industrial demand        for everything from semiconductors to solar panels, and producers can        raise output to take advantage of higher prices. Previous efforts to        corner the market have ultimately preceded crashes, most famously when        the Hunt brothers are alleged to have artificially boosted silver in        1979 and 1980.     

Still, the recent wave of speculation is unlike anything many in        commodities have witnessed in the recent past. Shares of miners like First        Majestic Silver Corp. and Hecla        Mining Co. have been among the stock market's best performers        recently -- each rose more than 20% on Monday -- while the largest        exchange-traded fund tied to silver logged its biggest-ever daily inflow        on Friday. Online silver dealers around the country have even reported        soaring demand from retail buyers.     

""It's become like the GameStop        of commodities,"" said Edward Meir, a consultant        focused on metals at brokerage ED&FMan Capital Markets.        ""It doesn't make any sense...It could be equally ugly on the way down.""     

The most actively traded silver futures advanced 9.3% to $29.42        a troy ounce, ending the day at a nearly eight-year high after briefly        rising above $30 earlier in the trading session. Prices        have risen nearly 15% in the past week, and Monday's climb marked the        metal's biggest advance since 2009.     

Silver's rally echoed the recent leap in GameStop        and AMC, propelled by a phalanx of individual traders gathering online.        Highlighting the risks associated with these trades, GameStop        shares fell more than 30% to $225 on Monday. Shares of        the struggling videogame retailer are still up some 1,100% in the past        month as traders undertake a ""short squeeze,"" forcing investors who had        bet on share-price declines to buy back stock at higher prices to        minimize their losses. That trend can add further fuel to rallies.     

Professional traders are now weighing whether the flurry of demand from        individuals can sustain the climb in silver -- a market where trading is        still concentrated in a small group of banks.     

""They can cause very significant disruption because silver is a market        with a history of very, very high volatility,"" said Tai Wong,        head of metal derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets.        ""But can they replicate a GameStop?        Unlikely.""     

The acting chairman of the Commodity        Futures Trading Commission, which regulates markets for silver        futures, said the agency is watching the action closely.     

""The commission is communicating with fellow regulators, the exchanges,        and stakeholders to address any potential threats to the integrity of        the derivatives markets for silver, and remains vigilant in surveilling        these markets for fraud and manipulation,"" Rostin Behnam,        the acting chairman, said in a statement Monday.     

Silver's climb to start the week was even more remarkable to market        watchers because gold rose only 0.7% and trading in other commodities        was muted. Gold and silver often trade in similar directions and are        seen as safe-haven investments during times of market turmoil.     

Depositories at CME        Group's Comex -- the biggest marketplace for silver futures -- are        brimming with almost 400 million troy ounces of silver, valued at around $12        billion at Monday's prices. Vaults in London        housed 1.1 billion troy ounces -- worth $29 billion -- at        the end of 2020, according to the London Bullion Market Association.     

Monday's advance followed a weekend rush to buy the physical metal --        which is used in electronics, jewelry and photography. Retail silver        marketplaces including Money Metals and APMEX Inc. had        notices on their websites Sunday saying they were unable to process new        orders until markets opened because of unprecedented demand.     

On Monday, many popular sites for purchasing silver and gold reported        shipping delays or other purchase restrictions.     

""Precious metals have never seen such a sudden surge in new interest,""        said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault.        Over the weekend, openings of new accounts at the online marketplace for        gold and silver rose to almost four times the daily average from 2020,        itself a record year since BullionVault went live in 2005, he said.     

Many traders and analysts are baffled by the moves in silver and said        the logic behind a ""short squeeze"" is also questionable.     

In GameStop's case, hedge        funds that had bet against the stock were forced to buy the retailer's        shares when individual investors drove the price higher to avoid bigger        losses, propelling the shares even more. But for silver, hedge funds and        other speculators actually have a net long position and stand to benefit        from rising prices, Commodity        Futures Trading Commission data show.     

""This is just a speculative boom,"" said Georgette Boele,        senior precious-metals strategist at ABN Amro Bank.     

A broad attempt by day traders to corner the market in silver wouldn't        be the first time someone has tried to dominate the precious metals        market. Analysts have alleged price manipulation in the silver market        going back several decades, including the episode with the Hunt brothers        more than four decades ago.     

Traders are also watching big inflows into the largest ETF tied to        silver, the iShares Silver Trust, and other large funds. These funds and        mining stocks are the easiest ways for individuals to bet on higher        prices. The fact that silver futures themselves are rising shows that        professionals are also trying to profit from the current excitement,        traders say.     

ETF buying can also add to market momentum because the traders who        manage the fund must buy physical silver when investors put more money        into the ETF. As a result, large inflows signal that the metals are in        high demand.     

Still, many professionals warn the silver rally will also end badly.     

""It's devoid of any fundamentals,"" Mr. Meir        said

Someone else made a post that they have have 7x more account signups this week than their average.

They have received a gigantic influx of new users and stand to become a haven for retail investors fucked over by their corrupt brokers (I have 151 GME in Robinhood and I am genuinely scared they are going to disappear).

However their UI is god awful and their app is basically unusable and almost never works for me. Imagine if they hired a team of software devs and wrote a new site and app to cater to younger investors. They could lock in an entire generation of users for life for the cost of like 10 peoples salary. They'd be fools not to do it.

They could even maintain the current site and maintain the new one under a subdomain. Now boomers can still click through 4 menus and refresh a static HTML page 3 times to trade a share and we can keep clicking buttons and stimulate our brains with bright colors and flashing images. Win-win.

So PENN owns barstool and sportsbooks, DKNG has daily fantasy and sports betting, and I think there are multiple reasons why buying calls would be good. The runup to the Superbowl, the increase in popularity of gambling/sports betting, and states will continue to legalize sportsbetting.

First off, the Superbowl is coming up on February 7th. You all know you are going to bet massive amounts this year with all your tendies. Mahomes and Brady is a huge draw. There is going to be record sports betting on the Superbowl which is going to signal massive growth for these companies.

Second, we've all become rich this year and have money to blow. We are the key demographic for sports gambling. Without a doubt we are going to see record inflows into sportsbetting in the future. It has the potential to be a trillion dollar industry. 

Third, US states are dying for money right now. Cuomo has said he wants to legalize sports betting in NY to help raise revenue. That is a huge market and would be huge for PENN and DKNG. ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article\_inline](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article_inline)). Here's a Cuomo quote from this article:

""New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the \[Covid-19\] crisis.”

I mean it is a no brainer for these states to legalize sports betting for raising revenue. No reason why other states wouldn't feel the same way as NY.

Everyone has become gambling degens now with the GME short squeeze. We need our fix. Sportsbetting is going to have massive growth. The tailwind of the Superbowl and states legalizing are going to cause these stocks to moon.

2021-02-01 22:24:43,BCRX: Get in before takeoff,0,"BCRX: The most undervalued stock in the market

First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track** status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that [98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market** based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. [The UK is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow [R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus) or [nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. [Optime care even lets patients get direct-to-patient prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that **its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,** and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

I am not the original poster I just think this DD was passed up so check it out!
