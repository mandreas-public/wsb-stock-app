This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (‚Äú**Blackberry**‚Äù) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry‚Äôs product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

We are currently a part of one of the most historical times in the history of the stock market. Now, it is incredibly evident how they will try to make us seem. We are a bunch of fucking degenerates. I mean, a lot of you get off on losing tens of thousands of dollars only to YOLO another weekly on a Thursday night. I get why the media would resent us, the corporations/hedge funds suckle from their teet so they take easy shots. Even though these hedge funds ARE CLEARLY in the wrong. 

We have shown there is strength in numbers and with 7.5M of us, what if we take a small portion of our profits and we create a thread to show, how we took our tendies from this (**WHEN IT IS OVER OFC**) to make the world a little bit better. You could use this post to make it or another, it does not matter. 

**Think about how the narrative could be. A group of Redditors beat the hedge funds and then immediately proceed to give their money back to charities/communities/etc doing more for the world than most hedge funds have ever done. Now picture this, with 7.5M+ of us, if we all donate $125 (an amount I think is doable if you are not paper-handed) that would conveniently be more than a billion dollars given to charities.** Yeah, a billion. While the media and hedge funds are bitching about how these hedge funds lost billions of dollars, here we are: ""a bunch of so-called degenerates putting billions of dollars into charities."" Now it is one thing to tell your kids one day, ""yeah I made a killing during the short squeeze of the millennia,"" but I was a part of something which gave a BILLION dollars to charity. The media would not be able to handle it. We have them on the ropes. Let's bite their fucking ear off while we are at it!

2021-02-01 01:31:04,GameStop DD May have 300 Million Total Shares- Be Careful,0,"GameStop has about 70 million total shares publicly traded today. 

However, their articles incorporation have an amendment that occurred in 2005 allowing them to authorize up to 300 million shares of Class A Common stock. See link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)

Item Four

Even if this was not available or was outdated I would say there is nearly 100% chance that GameStop will attempt to raise more capital at their new high valuation in one form or another (stock, bonds, combination, etc).

**Why?**

As a company that is in desperate need of a capital infusion, they need money. A year ago they were with $200 Million, today they can raise 10x that in a few days by issuing authorized shares and then their company probably has a real long-term shot. 

For them, this is a lifeline and a way that their company has a real chance to be more than a $20 Billion meme. 

This could allow the short sellers to buy back their positions and also lower the price. 

Not saying that it will tank the stock but certainly be aware of the possibility.

I am, however, a stock-trading gamer who is currently sipping Pinot while writing this up for your wife's boyfriend to read on the toilet later tonight, all because of the $GME gains.  


Haha gotcha. HOLD! Sorry, Musk, but once my shares head into space the only thing you are gonna be able to brag about is that you land spent rockets on sea platforms.  


GameStop is still a viable company. Make me CEO (or at the very least a VP of some sort) because my Pinot-drinking ass has some baller ass ideas.  


(1) GameStop needs to start an active campaign with gamers protesting our inability to physically own property that we purchased. When I bought *Legend of Zelda* in its sweet metallic cartridge, I was able to sensuously rub my fingertips along the¬†gold cartridge,¬†savoring the pattern of oily smudges my¬†callused hands left. I was able to trade it or sell it to someone, not to mention smell it. There was value in the game beyond just playing it. I could even sell it to GameStop for a whole dollar if I so chose.¬†

GameStop needs to be louder about this.  


Pok√©mon card collecting is still going strong. Folks are chasing physical cards, but what they are not doing is jumping to use the online codes shoved into each pack. Those are meaningless compared to the cards themselves. There is still a lot of demand for physical property, and this can be observed by thousands of gamers who wait in line for physical disk releases, many of whom are paying extra for ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô versions of their game.  


(1a) GameStop can use this buzz to make agreements with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo (and others of course) to allow them to sell ‚Äòownable‚Äô versions of digital games. Yes, digital is nice and convenient, but do I own my copy? Can I trade it or sell it for a different game? Allow us to do this with digital copies and GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PLAYERS. GameStop can step in and buy back and resell digital keys on their website.  


(2) GameStop needs to become involved in sponsorship of competitive gaming. HEAVILY! They should have a goal to become the go-to name in that rising sport. Why can‚Äôt they host competitions with buy-ins and payouts similar to professional poker tournaments? Why think of the GameStop brand as a simple brick-and-mortar retailer? Amazon sold books, for shit‚Äôs sake, now they are selling everything cheap East-Asian labor can produce while at the same time hosting web services. The sky's the limit.  


That's all I've got for now. I see three possible outcomes to this post: downvoted or disappeared into the dark void of Reddit new¬†(most likely); a series of shit posts about my wine (what are you degenerates drinking? Don't talk to me about your whiskey dicks); or, my personal preference, a running list of ‚Äò$GME go burrr‚Äô and ‚ÄòHOLD‚Äô responses. To the moon, babies.

More shit:....

so, if gamestop and AMC merge, GME can try to bring back the arcade to some small extent (there are various ways that I see to go about this) and in that way, parents have less expensive baby sitters because they can take a date night and drop their kids at the arcade for a couple of hours to have some fun. If dad wants to, he can step out of the movie to use the restroom and check on the kids real quick. Kids get to play Call of Duty or Galaga or Animal Crossing. Us diamond-handed motherfuckers get to bring back nostalgia companies and get rich in the process that way we can go spend more money and GameStop and AMC.

more More Shit:
Even a merger would be cool. GME does not necessarily need yo buy AMC.

Extra side of shit: 
E-sports comps during the day and then matinee in the...matinee time.

Man I have to pee right now:
I should clarify that I don‚Äôt see this happening at all. It would be amazing, but this is corporate America and shit is not as black and white as we make it seem here. With that, I would really love it if this came to fruition. Until then, it shall remain an active traders fan-fiction pipe dream üòÑ

2021-02-01 01:14:10,Americans: taxes on tendies,71,"Have been seeing a lot of posts on taxes without details on what/where you owe (and confused apes in the comments). Here are the basics (not a professional cpa; just someone offering some basic advice):

If you are trading in a tax-exempt account (IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc): congratulations, you don‚Äôt have to worry about taxes on your tendies (at least for now)

If you are trading in a standard brokerage account, keep reading:

1) if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days,* the profit is considered short term capital gains. However, all cap gains/losses are considered together (write off losses against gains). 

Example: you bought $10k GME Jan 1. Sold GME in April (diamond hands) for $1,000,000. That is $990k profit. Now if you decided you‚Äôve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset, you owe taxes on the $990k. The tax rate will depend on other income you have. It is taxed as regular income tax. Look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation (ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single). Rule of thumb: set aside 40% (usually will be more than enough). 

Example 2: However let‚Äôs say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in July 2021. Sadly, your $990k is a total loss. Over the net of this tax year, you have no gains/no losses. You owe no additions taxes. 

2) now, if you bought GME Jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in February 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2,000, you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes.  That $2k will be taxed at the long-term cap gains rate for tax year 2022. For 2020 tax year, those tax brackets (single filers) are 0% if your total income is less than $40k, 15% for income between 40 and 440k, and 20% if over that). Note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned CA‚Äôs is 13-14% (please confirm for your state). If you have other losses, you can write those off against the gains same as before. 

Also tip: all of this is SUPER easy to do in TurboTax. TurboTax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically. It‚Äôs super easy to use even you apes can use it. If you have a simple tax situation (eg just your tendies and your regular 9-5), just go with TurboTax. They also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help. 




*365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this + 1 day for stocks (ie buy Jan 1, 2021.. sell before Jan 2, 2022, it is short term)


Edit to add: potential state cap gains taxes"
2021-02-01 01:14:08,Stress Management In Planning,65,"ü¶çü¶ç HOLD üçåüçå

##NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations. This is particularly  true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution. **The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.**

&#x200B;

The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition. What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached. There is a ***reason*** why the plan was made prior, in the calm. Remember, we are dumb-ass ü¶çü¶ç figuratively and quite literally.

&#x200B;

**Everything you do should be done with calm intent.** That means, if you planned to hold no matter what, **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to ~~sell~~ buy, set your limits and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan? Go have a üçåüçå if tempted to peek.

&#x200B;

The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake 99.9999% of the time. In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea. The time for open-mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams. Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.

&#x200B;

Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results. If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made. This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.

&#x200B;

###TL;DR **Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.** No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time. Calm ü¶ç > Panicked ü¶ç

&#x200B;

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

&#x200B;

*Processing img wjmo0jkiwre61...*

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world‚Äôs largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

&#x200B;

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9)

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon. Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative."

2021-02-01 02:03:20,"Reasons why GME is unique, and reasons why no there‚Äôs no next GME",19,"TLDR: GME is probably the first/only stock that is going to have a squeeze, if there is going to be one. There CAN be no squeeze for GME, but other stocks have much less probability of having a squeeze.

1. GME has a short interest of 100% float, which is unique for now. (but not very uncommon in the history.)

2. GME has very limited convertible bonds (based on my understanding of the financial report). Unlike amc where institutions can simply convert their bonds into float shares.

3. GME will have a good cash flow due to console cycle, and has more cash than debt based on last report. Not many other meme stocks are earning money right now. So the company can survive without an offering. Making the company as a whole üíéüñêÔ∏è

4. GME has a large group of üíéüñêÔ∏è, you can barely see any other stocks have so many big balls and diamond hands, even in the history of the sub. I personally did not see many üíéüñêÔ∏è for other stocks in this sub. I guess other stocks just have so many paper hands. As a result, other stocks are less likely to have a squeeze.
(Another stock has so many diamond hands in this sub is probably TSLA.)


5. GME itself is in part of the history right now. It definitely has some historical value.


6. GME just change its board. Ryan Cohen is going to help manage the business in his own interest. The other stocks may have board against the interest of WSBs.( they may claim to help the company ‚Äúin the long term‚Äù and harm share holders who only want to play the squeeze."

Regular people(the 99%) will go back to the movies. Not only are theaters intergenerational, but also they are social hubs. I can see why people fearing COVID have stayed away, but we know vaccines are gonna keep coming.

I already have been. I even bought a $10 popcorn and a $5 soda. While I snuck in some candy, in hindsight I was ripped off. However, I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I had a great time and immersive experience I can‚Äôt have in my own home. I will go more.

## We like it

Just as a thought exercise, think of some reasons why you would go (doesn‚Äôt work if you are filthy rich. GTFO wallstreet).

- Grandma wants to see magic mike on big screen

- Family movie night to pretend y‚Äôall are bonding

- took girl on date their because because then I won‚Äôt have to conversation (autist, it worked)

- take girlfriend on date at movies because we‚Äôve been together for years and have nothing to conversation about 

- Star Wars ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è drops a new movie, every showing is packed for the next few weeks.

I‚Äôm gonna end the list here before I give too much insight to the rich, but if you are poor like me I encourage you to continue this thought exercise. Movie theaters have been central to film culture since early 20th century. The wealthy are losing touch with plebeian culture, let‚Äôs make them pay for itüöÄüöÄ.

2021-02-01 01:53:50,Proposal to have WSB get a seat on the GameStop board,47,"I read over u/johnnydaggers post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/). If it is true that retail collectively owns 100% of Gamestop, and WSB probably makes up 30-50% of the ownership, we should organize to elect someone to represent our interest in the company.

We actually could have real influence on how the company could be run. We could write up proposals and vote on the best strategy we think GameStop should take moving forward.

We would need to find someone here who has some corporate experience and would be willing to take on this responsibility.

It may be tricky to quantify exactly how many shares WSB collectively owns. I wonder if we could ask Robinhood to give us the numbers of shares that are held collectively in Robinhood, and use that as a starting point to figure out what the percentages look like. Robinhood released the # of shares held on Robinhood a year ago, we could elect a representative to communicate with Robinhood's higher ups to have them release the numbers to us.

Side note: If more than 100% of total outstanding shares of GME is held on Robinhood, then we know that there is some shady counterfeit stock accounting going on. That would open up a whole new can of worms.

Thoughts on this?

Edit: Probably would create a lot of legal trouble and might actually be illegal. Also might be on the hook for market manipulation. Still, its fun to think about."

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are.

2021-02-01 01:48:39,Why Robinhood is not the enemy,0,"Robinhood was a great idea for Citadel.  Make a sexy and ‚Äúgamified‚Äù stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.  

But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.

Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.

I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?

Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let‚Äôs face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won‚Äôt encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.

So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn‚Äôt care about retail traders.

The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions.

1. Take a breath.  You've got a form of mania and dopamine that will be difficult to replicate.
2. Don't tell anyone.  Personally, I haven't told my spouse about this potential windfall.
3. Taxes.  Call your richest friend and ask them for a recommendation on a CPA.
4. Meet with the CPA to understand best how to handle the financial requirements to prevent future pain.  You will ask the CPA for their best fee-based estate planning recommendation.
5. If you are paying off other people's debts, ask your CPA (step 4) what the tax implications for the recipient.
6. If you have dependents, figure out how best to plan for their future by creating a trust or something else for their future.
7. Most people here currently have health insurance.  Ask your other retired or independent friends about what they do for health insurance.  Don't forget dental and optical insurance.
8. Decide how you are going to sustain your lifestyle without a steady income.  Dividends, Market Growth, CD's, etc. (This will feel REALLY boring compared to the last few months!)
9. YOLOing into memes isn't sustainable.  But save some fun money to feed your addiction.
10. Figure out a budget!!!!!
11. Determine if you are going to let your extended family/neighbors know.  I will be going the ""consulting on my own"" route rather than ""I yoloed on a meme and got lucky"".
12. Determine what immediate thing for gratification you'll purchase or acquire or reward.
13. Determine how you will pay for it as part of the budgeting process.
14. Once you've confirmed the above, go DO the thing, travel to the place, eat tendies.

I will be paying off all outstanding lunch debt in my district for the elementary schools.
