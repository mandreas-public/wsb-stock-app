2021-02-02 01:19:24,You keep seeing 100K - 1m+ gains. Well here are some poor man gains +1.5k,9,
2021-02-02 01:19:07,"My thoughts on GME (surprisingly very bullish) I can't figure out how to make the rocket emoji right now, sorry",4,"GME is outrageously shorted right now, there is super low volume, all we need is a catalyst to bring this boy home. GME with Ryan is $150, paying $100 for serious blowup potential is fair value. The stock becomes dangerously valuable when the price is $400 so nobody should feel bad about paying $400 +, since the financial system was literally teetering off a cliff from the literal gamma rays your autist stock was emitting. Obviously, we are losing right now since we don't have cool algos that can trade shares back and forth from each other. This could last for a while. 

I think either hedge funds are aware of the very real risk of this blowing up on their face OR someone is laying a short trap and they (realistically not all of them) bought a massive position in March 19th calls @ 800. It's like a multi-million premium and since its so OTM and sentiment is terrible right now, I assume its like a 20 billion banger waiting to go off. Also this, can always squeeze but with the calls placed, there will be different winners and losers bearing the risk of loss. Also massive gamma as we approach $400 + again.  (dino sized gamma, much larger than last time)

The game now at this point is attrition, you need cash to push a price up and you need cash to push a price down.  Point72 just reopened their fund to new investors for the past week. I heard Citadel is trying to scrape money with silver shills. Funds are down probably 15% and are strapped for cash.  Pretty much it looks like everyone on Wall Street is sucking some serious dick for more ammo to spit on your face. All I can say is if you are thinking of buying shares of GME, feel free to do so now, I think all it takes is a few whales to knock this long. Trying to short this into the ground from $200 onwards to $0 is just exposing them to another coming of Christ (DFV round 2). This company is never going bankrupt at this point, you autists will just buy all your food and water from Gamestop. They can literally only wait for shareholders to get bored. They can literally never close their positions at this point. They are stuck. The fact that everyone is a retard here and did not sell (jesus u tools) and the fact that there's clearly home run potential for anyone with deep pockets to first crush the price a bit then long into an infinity squeeze. 

These guys will break rules to not lose but I can see one or two make a play to win big (to fleece the rest). Other than relying on retards to not switch from a free transaction broker to a real broker, there are literally NO options left for a hedge fund. Especially hedge fund on hedge fund action. You don't have to buy today or tomorrow, but the volume decreases by the day and the logic of what I'm forecasting seems more and more realistic.

A note from Robinhood
Hi [REDACTED],

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?” 

We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms. 

To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below:
For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds. 
We hope you take away this: at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.

Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.
Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team

2021-02-02 01:16:54,Robinhood’s regulations led to me taking on MORE risk,14,"Sup tards, 

Today I had 83 shares, 2 debit spreads and about 5k cash. Because RH is corrupt I couldn’t buy any more shares. I planned on transferring to Fidelity but my funds wouldn’t settle until Thursday (so depending on the withdrawal time I might not have my funds in fidelity until next week) and I wanted to get in on the dip. I would’ve just bought more shares but again, corrupt. Fuck RH. I hope Vlad goes to prison. 

Anyways I tried to buy another debit spread - buy the 2/5 240 call, sell the 300 call. Limited upside but also limited downside. Well those whores wouldn’t let me bc technically my other spreads count as 4 contracts.... the fuk? and you’re only allowed to have 5 contacts....THE FUK? 

so I ended up buying the 2/5 265 call. Obviously I’m getting porked on it right now and it dawned on me that those fuckers are supposedly limiting my buying IN MY BEST INTEREST when in reality it would’ve been in my best interest to let me do what I fucking want with my own money and buy the other leg of my spread. I’d be down a helluva lot less if RH let me trade freely. 

So in my mind that makes it one of 2 things. They’re either 
         a) completely in bed with MMs and Hedge Funds. When they say “being there for our customers” they’re talking about Citadel. 
         b) complete pussies. Clearinghouses put pressure on them by raising deposit requirements and RH says “yes daddy.” They put up no fight. They don’t stick their neck out for customers at all. They roll over and lie about their bitchness

Take your pick, either way I’m gtfo as soon as the squeeze is squoze. GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀  💎💎diamond fuckin hands, let’s make RH go broke"

2021-02-02 01:14:42,💎🙌 or death,18,"Woken by a sudden explosion from what seemed like only a few meters away, Private Boomer violently jumped to his feet and reached for his weapon between the dirty pile of clothes he made into a makeshift bed. “Those cocksuckers, will never let me rest”, he then uttered almost by memory “I must continue to hold my ground”. These words now burned into his mind, as he recalls they were once echoed by Private Boomer’s commander Major Cohen, whom he has not heard from in many weeks.
Not hearing from Major Cohen depressed Private Boomer as another night passed. It seemed the bombings were much greater in the night, after the markets have closed and everyone went home, blood can be seen on the streets. Private Boom is again startled this time by a familiar voice screaming in agony. Outside the window one of Private Boomer’s mate now lies half dead on the street.  Private Boomer is unable to make out the face of the soldier who now glances up at the window where Private Boomer is looking, making direct eye contact. 


The solider now laboring to breath, yells “do not look away, all of you!”, “it was the vendor at the market place.” Sobbing the solider continued, “I swear to you, first the vendor lined us up and refused to sell us any water, or food… Robin the vender at the market place is a spy, please believe me!”. His voice now fading as a panic crowd now gathered around the body. Another soldier can be heard saying “Robin would not do that, surely this solider is mad, tomorrow let us all surrender our gems to the Vin-Elm army first thing in the morning”. In a triumphant last gasp the dying solider yells “NO!”, the crowd immediately hushed, “Vin-Elm would have to take this from my cold dead hands”. The soldier’s body then jerks as he passed away clutching his gems, the only wealth he had left on this earth.

A loud knock on the door brings Private Boomer back into the dark dirty room. “I know you’re in there” said the voice. Fearing the worst Private Boomer looks back out the window into the streets, now empty, expect for the body of the brave dead soldier.  It was as if it were yesterday, a boy sitting at the kitchen table, eating tendies, without a worry in the world, these images flashed through Private Boomer’s mind. Private Boomer now remembered his wife, the days she would sneak him into the bedroom, in what seemed to be forever waiting for HIM to leave… fuck him, fuck Vin-Elm, fuck this war, I didn’t want this fight… “Private Boomer” said a voice which sounded like his wife’s boyfriend. “PRIVATE BOOMER”! 

The bewildered solider handed Private Boomer a letter, and said “it’s from Major Cohen, it’s to be kept confidential you autistic bitch”. “Okay” said Private Boomer. “Thank you sir”, said the solider as he left the room. Private Boomer did not know if he should read the letter, after all Robin is probably speaking to the Vin-Elm army at this very moment, preparing another bombing that will wipe out the rest of his platoon. 


Private Boomer slowly opens the letter.
“Hello Private Boomer, as you know the war efforts aren’t going as planned. My intelligence has uncovered a plot by Vin-Elm to destroy our army by destroying our supply chain. In your midst there are many spies, one in particular is named Robin. I pray your supply chain is not broken yet. However, if your supply chain has been compromised we do have a trusted source to the south, his name is Fidel (no not the communist dictator you autistic bitch). Fidel will help you restock in munitions, food and water. 

After that you must find a way to destroy Vin-Elm’s unlimited supply of money. Our unit has tried to invest is more GME aircraft, but were told by the banks they would limit our ability to acquire GME aircraft to protect ourselves from unnecessary risk. However, the bank continues to lend to Vin-Elm’s army at close to zero % interest despite their highly risky behaviors. Please plan accordingly, it will take a few days to reach Fidel from your vantage point. I will update you with good news shortly, please wait for that message. And one more thing, hold! “"

Link here- [WSB movie ](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm)

Obviously they’re going to need some info for this movie so what better to know than what the members of wallstreetbets were thinking during this whole fiasco? They’re going to want details of us on our red days, our green days, the days where the short squeeze felt out of reach and the day the short squeeze begins. So comment your current thoughts when GME is currently down 50% to $189.52.

You are exponentially more fucking stupid than those of us who have been gambling on fds for years and losing all our gains on a regular basis. 

You are so fucking retarded you can’t even find your own trade in a different stock or market. You fucking fucks are just here because you think you’re contributing to some sort of “noble” cause. 

You are being played like a puppet on a strong thinking you have any power whatsoever to compete with asset managers handling TRILLIONS in assets. 

Take the GME dildo out of your ass, shove up down your throat, and fuck off already. 

This is a sub for Wall Street BETS. Go find your own stock and place a bet on some far otm fds like a real autist you bandwagon fucks. 

Go start a GME man orgy sub for yourselves and “stick it to the man.” You are NOT true degenerate pieces of shit like the rest of us who have been doing this for years.

2021-02-02 01:10:58,A Message to WSB,78,"First off, I want to say how proud I am of you retards. I've been watching people lose their entire life savings and still hold the line. I joined WSB in December (have been lurking for months prior with my buddies) and fuck has the time flown. I can't believe how much time (and money) I've invested into this subreddit. 

**One point I just wanted to mention is:** IF the brokers and MMs somehow manage to get away with very illegal market manipulation, in the open and in front of the entire internet, I personally won't be throwing the majority of my paychecks into the stock market anymore. Before the comments section obliterates both my self-respect and karma, I just have to mention that I definitely can't be alone in this. We've had 6 million+ users join us in the past month alone. Also, over 50% of Robinhood users own GME. This isn't just some ordinary situation where WSB loses money, this is a war between the corrupt 1% on Wall Street and the entire rest of the world. I've seen thousands of posts from people joining the cause from countries I can't even pronounce. 

Us coming out on the losing end of this one would just solidify to millennials and zoomers everywhere that gambling our money in the stock market wouldn't benefit us. Why would anyone be willing to play a game that is rigged against them? 

That being said, I truly do naively believe that the SEC or Congress will have to step in and chalk up a win for the fellas on WSB soon. If they don't, that's potentially millions of people and tens if not hundreds of billions that our future generation won't be willing to invest in our economy, just because the market could be manipulated against us without any serious repercussions.

But until that point, you'll have to pry my 100 shares of GME at $87.00 from my lifeless body if you think I'm going to abandon ship now. It's a cheap price to pay for some long overdue justice, not only for ourselves but for everyone in 08'. Furthermore, you'd be very wrong if you think I'm ever leaving this community full of wonderful, regular people trying to do something better with their lives. Loss porn is the only thing that gets me hard anymore and we all know there will always be plenty of that to go around here.

What does this mean? If short interest really did drop(no one really believes that right?) then new shorts are being opened, especially if they think they can drive the price down using ladders and other manipulation. If you continue to hold there can be a short squeeze, maybe a second stage booster if you will. The new shorts instead of being in at $20 are now in at $110. This means they will probably hold longer until they cover. Could easily go back up, not just to the moon but Mars or Pluto or another Galaxy.
